Welcome to our intrest Calculator Program!
	This is an interactive program which promotes the user to choose an intrest rate and a principle.
	The program will then calculate and prints the balance that would be after one year!
	Moreover the program will display monthly balance assuming that the intrest is compounded monthly.
	The program will promote the user to enter y , Yes or yup.. etc if they wish to do another calculation, and N or No if they wish to exit.
	


Enjoy! Thank you!
